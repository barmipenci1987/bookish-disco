### Step-by-Step Guide to Install Quicken

#### Step 3: Allow Permissions


Upon opening the installation file, your screen may prompt you with a User Account Control (UAC) warning. This is a standard security measure in Windows. Click “Yes” to allow the installer to make changes to your system.


#### Step 4: Choose the Installation Type


You will be presented with two installation types: “Standard” and “Custom.” For most users, the Standard option is recommended as it installs the necessary components automatically. However, if you prefer to select specific features, choose Custom.

#### Step 6: Select the Installation Location


Choose where you want Quicken to be installed. The default location is usually sufficient. Click “Next” to continue.

Once you've finalized your preferences, click on the Install button. The installation process will begin, and it may take a few moments to complete.


#### Step 8: Launch Quicken


After the installation is complete, you will see an option to launch Quicken immediately. Click on that, or navigate to the Start menu to find your new software.


### Post-Installation Setup Tips


Once Quicken has been successfully installed, follow these initial setup tips to make the most out of the software:
